        <section class="content e-content">
            <p>Monday morning, I got up a little earlier than usual, and —despite being pretty tired— was looking forward to getting back to the gym. I&rsquo;d taken a week off to get over a cold, and while I&rsquo;d have to reduce the weight I was lifting to avoid soreness, it felt <em>really good</em> to have recovered enough to get some exercise.</p>
<p>In our apartment, everything was ready for my triumphant return, too: my gym clothes were neatly folded and ready to go, the coffee machine was ready to brew, and I had all the ingredients I needed for a quick pre-workout snack (9-grain toast with orange marmelade and peanut butter, if you must know).</p>
<p>And yet&hellip; I found myself having a very hard time getting out the door.</p>
<p>Why? Because since Saturday night, we&rsquo;d gotten a bunch of freezing rain followed by snow, and the thought of having to de-ice my car felt like a huge hassle that I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with.</p>
<p>Sorry, let me rephrase that: it was a huge hassle that I didn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to deal with.</p>
<p>In other words, I&rsquo;m feeling lazy about going to the gym because I&rsquo;m <em>allowed</em> to be lazy about it. When you think about it, skipping the day&rsquo;s workout didn&rsquo;t have any <em>real</em> consequence (unlike, say, skipping a day of going to work), but it also had no real, immediate <em>reward</em>, either (unlike, say&hellip; going to the guitar shop to buy a new guitar, I dunno).</p>
<p>So there I was, yanking on door handles trying to get into my car, realizing that it&rsquo;s surrounded by hardpack snow that&rsquo;ll require going back up to my apartment to get a shovel, and watching the available time for a workout that morning dwindle.</p>
<p>You can bet that if I had to get into that car to drive to a job, or to pick up a new <a href="https://shop.fender.com/en/intl/electric-guitars/telecaster/american-performer-telecaster-hum/0115122341.html">Telecaster</a>, I&rsquo;d have made it happen. But having neither the forcing function of work nor the reward of made-in-California twangy goodness, the motivation to get into that car and on my way to Do The Thing™ was approaching zero, and that I&rsquo;d have to rely on good ol' discipline.</p>
<p>And really, all I could really think to myself was: <em>Montreal winter: 1, Discipline: 0</em>. Also, that my bed was probably still pretty warm.</p>
<p>Well, it was worth a shot.</p>
<p>The thing is, discipline isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing that goes from zero to one easily. Discipline is built on routine. On habit. On showing up, day after day. And sure, I try to go to the gym fairly regularly, but after two and a half weeks of sleeping in because of holidays and then illness, my routine had been broken.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re trying to kick off a new habit, you can rely on your motivation to get started, but you&rsquo;ll also want to stack the deck in your favour, too. Setting yourself up to develop discipline can be made easier by two things: minimizing the friction between where you are and where you want to be, and rewarding yourself for actually doing the thing you&rsquo;re trying to make a habit of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to look at a protein shake as a reward for going to the gym. There&rsquo;s pretty much nothing good about going to the gym, in my opinion, beyond <em>eventually</em> witnessing some progress. So for now, I need to focus on minimizing friction. I <em>thought</em> I did a pretty good job of making sure that I was ready to go, but really I failed to account for the biggest obstacle: fighting the elements.</p>
<p>How could I have made that hurdle lower (i.e., set myself up for success)?</p>
<p>I know that getting into the car afterwards dumping of freezing rain and snow is a lot harder than just dusting off some snow, so I could have instead taken public transit and/or walked. This multiplies my travel time by a factor of about four or five, and nearly doubles the amount of time I have to dedicate to my workout. That extra time commitment then eats into the other stuff I do in the morning, which is the opposite of a reward. Knowing myself, that isn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>
<p>I could have instead gone out and cleared the ice and snow on Sunday afternoon, so that the car would be ready to go Monday morning. In fact, I was telling myself that I should exactly that, after a morning of chores. And if I needed to drive to work or go buy that Tele, you can be sure I would have found the energy to do that. But instead, I mostly convinced myself that it probably wasn&rsquo;t too bad and I could leave it to the next day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a word for this: procrastination. But that&rsquo;s a topic for another day, because I think there&rsquo;s a more subtle and interesting takeaway here.</p>
<p>What fascinates me is how good and positive I felt about what Monday morning would look like, as Sunday evening crept towards bedtime. Somehow, I&rsquo;d already done the calculus that I was going to have a tough time getting where I needed to go. And still, I was able to push the impending failure outside my door to the back of my mind, and instead point to all the things I&rsquo;d done right in my immediate environment to slam dunk a home run.</p>
<p>(Clearly, I&rsquo;m not a sports person.)</p>
<p>Yes, skipping the gym is trivial, but it points to something bigger: the ability to tell myself that everything&rsquo;s great <em>and trick my mind and body into believing it</em> when there&rsquo;s obvious evidence to the contrary. This is powerful, and insidious, and probably invades other, more important things. I sometimes describe myself as a &ldquo;cautious optimist&rdquo; — but maybe I&rsquo;m not as cautious as I think.</p>
<p>This is probably also why reflection and introspection have made such a difference in my life. There are only so many times you can fool yourself when you&rsquo;re faced with the same evidence week after week. That gut-check is something I&rsquo;m doing more and more of in my weekly retrospectives as I focus on less and less, and while I still have a long way to go, being more honest with myself about the time, energy, and attention I have available is already paying off.</p>

<h2 id="interesting-reads-this-week">Interesting reads this week</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying something new, where I&rsquo;ll share two or three articles that I read this week (they may be relatively new, or really old — so long as I read them this week).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://wattenberger.com/blog/react-hooks">Thinking in React Hooks — Amelia Wattenberger</a>:</strong> Not only is this a fantastic explainer of the mindset shift required to make the most of React Hooks, I really love the interactive presentation of the post&rsquo;s code examples. This isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing that can be done anywhere but on one&rsquo;s own website. (H/T: <a href="https://keith.is">Keith Kurson</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-wages-of-productivity">The Wages of Productivity — Anne Helen Petersen</a>:</strong> I first became aware of AHP from <a href="https://hurryslowly.co/anne-helen/">this interview</a> on the Hurry Slowly podcast. The fetishization of productivity is invading our leisure in ways that not only exhaust us, but —more dangerously— fuel classism and further divide our society. (H/T: <a href="https://hurryslowly.co/newsletter/">Jocelyn K. Glei&rsquo;s newsletter</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2019/02/04/brainstorming-how-i-start-a-project/">Brainstorming: how I start a project — Brett Terpstra</a>:</strong> I&rsquo;m fascinated by the <em>idea</em> of mind-mapping (and have been purchasing MindNode&rsquo;s upgrades for years now), but for some reason, it&rsquo;s just not something that I jump to when I want to brainstorm on and/or flesh out a project. I think that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve never been sure how to start, exactly, and this article (along with BT&rsquo;s related mind-mapping posts) has given me some ideas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
