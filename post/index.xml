      <description>I sometimes describe myself as a &amp;ldquo;cautious optimist&amp;rdquo;, but maybe I&#39;m not as cautious as I think?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite having fifty-two weekly retrospectives over four notebooks to look back on, I didn&#39;t write up any kind of &amp;ldquo;2019 In Review&amp;rdquo; post here. I did spend the morning of New Years Eve writing up an annual retrospective, though, as discussed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.makebeforebreak.com/17&#34;&gt;episode 17 of Make Before Break&lt;/a&gt;; I just didn&#39;t share any findings and insights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to chat with &lt;a href=&#34;https://anildash.com&#34;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt; about tech and self-care on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://glitch.com/culture/function-episode-13/&#34;&gt;Function podcast&#39;s season 2 kickoff&lt;/a&gt;. Function examines the intersection of tech and culture, and I&#39;m grateful to have been invited to share my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://glitch.com&#34;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt; CEO &lt;a href=&#34;https://anildash.com&#34;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt; got to interview Mindy Kaling at Twilio&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.twilio.com/2019/sf&#34;&gt;SIGNAL conference&lt;/a&gt;. We built an &lt;a href=&#34;https://glitch.com/~2019signal-qsformindy&#34;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; that let people text in their questions for Mindy, and it added a lot of fun interactivity to their chat!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Indigo Update: Custom CSS</title>
      <link>https://angelostavrow.com/post/indigo-theme-updates/</link>

      <guid>https://angelostavrow.com/post/indigo-theme-updates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This site runs a customized version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo&#34;&gt;Indigo&lt;/a&gt; — essentially, a different colour palette and some custom styling for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://angelostavrow.com/updates&#34;&gt;Updates&lt;/a&gt; page. Because of this, it&#39;s always been a bit of a headache to update to the latest version of the theme. No more! I&#39;m happy to announce that you can now easily import custom CSS into Indigo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Improved Hugo theme workflows coming</title>
      <link>https://angelostavrow.com/post/new-indigo-workflows/</link>

      <guid>https://angelostavrow.com/post/new-indigo-workflows/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been over 10 months since I &lt;a href=&#34;https://angelostavrow.com/post/introducing-indigo/&#34;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; my theme for Hugo, called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo&#34;&gt;Indigo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some changes have been made since launch, but it always seems to take so much longer to build out new features or fix bugs than I&#39;d like, and a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/issues/678&#34;&gt;breaking change&lt;/a&gt; in Hugo 0.57 (temporarily rolled back in 0.57.2) that I have to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/issues/52&#34;&gt;fix&lt;/a&gt; really drove that point home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a week since &lt;a href=&#34;https://ioscoachfrank.com/&#34;&gt;Frank&lt;/a&gt; and I wrapped up and released the final episode for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.makebeforebreak.com/&#34;&gt;Make Before Break&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s first season. Here are a few things we learned about making a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks the second anniversary of my gig at &lt;a href=&#34;https://glitch.com&#34;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Fog Creek Software). Last year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://angelostavrow.com/post/remote-work-year-one/&#34;&gt;I wrote a retrospective&lt;/a&gt; on what the first year of working remotely was like; I thought it’d be fun to see how that’s evolved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love cooking, and get myself little gadgets and tools for the kitchen more often than I should, because having the right tool for the job makes things so much more pleasant and makes me more effective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time reading, and I&#39;ve been thinking about periodically writing up a list of articles that I&#39;ve recently enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&#39;m big on RSS (&lt;a href=&#34;https://feedbin.com&#34;&gt;Feedbin&lt;/a&gt; is my RSS service of choice), I do &lt;a href=&#34;https://feedbin.com/blog/2016/02/03/subscribe-to-email-newsletters-in-feedbin/&#34;&gt;also use it to subscribe to a few weekly newsletters&lt;/a&gt; — here are my current favourites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://angelostavrow.com/post/hello-2019/&#34;&gt;Last week I wrote&lt;/a&gt; about defining my goals a bit more carefully, making sure that projects I undertake fit &lt;em&gt;who I want to be&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how I feel&lt;/em&gt;, set in the context of &lt;em&gt;what I’m capable of&lt;/em&gt;. Part of that meant making some hard decisions about which projects I&#39;ll put in my backlog, and which projects I&#39;ll drop altogether. The work I&#39;d started on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://angelostavrow.com/post/app-store-reviews-in-manuscript/&#34;&gt;Manuscript integration&lt;/a&gt; is one of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://angelostavrow.com/post/hello-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m being a bit more careful about defining goals this year. Certainly, there are some things that I&#39;m aiming to do, or that I need to do, but these things have to be balanced against the universe not especially giving a damn about my wants and needs — and I need to be okay with that. But more importantly, I&#39;m working harder on timeboxing my projects in OmniFocus, for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday marked the end of my time working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://manuscript.com&#34;&gt;Manuscript&lt;/a&gt;, as the transition of the product over to its new owner is complete. With that, I&#39;d been looking for a new contract, and today I&#39;m happy to announce that I&#39;ll be joining the team at &lt;a href=&#34;https://glitch.com/about/&#34;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My main social network these days is &lt;a href=&#34;https://micro.blog/&#34;&gt;Micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, where I post short updates, thoughts, and images, then syndicate those posts out to the big social media silos. I have a hosted blog on the Micro.blog service for this, but because I want this site to be the canonical source for &lt;em&gt;all things Angelo&lt;/em&gt;, I wanted to pull in that content here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While v1.0 of my first Hugo theme, Indigo, was &lt;a href=&#34;https://angelostavrow.com/post/introducing-indigo/&#34;&gt;released two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, it was only added to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/indigo/&#34;&gt;Hugo themes gallery&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GoHugoIO/status/1051911902966763521&#34;&gt;tweeted about&lt;/a&gt; from the Hugo account) five days ago. Since then, I&#39;ve learned a couple of things that I thought I&#39;d share.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indigo is a lightweight theme for &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt; features baked in. It&#39;s great for longer-form blogging, placing its focus on distraction-free reading and beautiful typefaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We lost our little buddy one year ago today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was the sweetest animal I&#39;ve ever known. The thing I remember most about him: you barely had to say two words to him, and he&#39;d start purring loudly, probably followed by him flopping onto his back for fluffy belly rubs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Feedback Loops</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A feedback loop is system where the output is &lt;em&gt;fed back&lt;/em&gt; into the system as an input. They exist everywhere in nature, and they typically come in two flavours: positive feedback loops, which move things away from a state of equilibrium, and negative feedback loops, which work to preserve balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Standing still is generally a safe bet. We don&#39;t have to expend any energy, and we don&#39;t have to concern ourselves much with the possible outcomes. We just stand there, and watch the world go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making progress is a little different. Making progress is risky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Since mid-February, a notebook has become a big part of my productivity system. There&#39;s something about putting pen to paper that&#39;s inherently more satisfying to me than poking at keys to make characters appear on a screen. Over six months later, I&#39;m still writing in it daily.
I don&#39;t carry my notebook with me everywhere, though. I carry very little with me, in fact: my phone, wallet, and my keys (and really, only the keys that I need).</description>

      <title>Glitch Project Name Lottery</title>

      <guid>https://angelostavrow.com/post/glitch-project-name-lottery/</guid>
      <description>Glitch creates randomized project names when you remix a project, and they look something like adjective-noun.glitch.me. You can always rename these later, but oftentimes they’re just too amusing to bother (I’m looking at you, victorious-beer).
So, what if you decided that you were going to remix the node starter app, and then had to spend a couple of hours building an app based purely on the random name you were assigned?</description>

      <description>Tell me if any of this sounds familiar:
 Why am I having such a hard time with this? What&#39;s wrong with me? Maybe I’m not smart enough to do this. People hired me to do this work, but I&#39;m never going to figure this out. I&#39;m a fraud.  There are at least a couple of common threads with these statements, but I think the most interesting one is that each of these statements is an implicit comparison that I&#39;m making between myself and someone that&#39;s, y&#39;know, good at what they do.</description>

      <title>App Store Reviews in Manuscript</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve got some iOS apps as side projects (they&#39;re in dire need of updates, but that&#39;s neither here nor there). To keep things organized, I use a Manuscript (née FogBugz) account that I opened six years ago for planning work and, more relevant to this post, to capture (almost) all customer feedback. There&#39;s a custom mailbox set up with an email address in my business domain, to which customers can send questions and comments about the apps.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, Julia Evans wrote a retrospective on what it’s been like working remotely that resonated with me, given that today is my one-year anniversary since taking a remote position. Since this is my first fully-remote job, taking some time to reflect on how things have gone seems like a good idea.
Julia answered some great questions about working remotely, so I’ll do the same here.

      <description>I&#39;ve slowly been moving over to Things 3 for task management, but more than that, I&#39;ve been re-thinking just how my system needs to be fleshed out so that it works best for me.
As part of that move, I&#39;ve been re-evaluating the way I think about capture. Typically, you&#39;ve got an inbox, where you log all the incoming stuff in your life, and which you process periodically. That&#39;s fine for the usual do-delegate-delete-defer type tasks, but if I want to use Things (or whatever task management system) to capture everything, I&#39;ve found that I need a place for things that live somewhere between the inbox and a project.</description>

      <description>I mentioned the other day that I&#39;m feeling a little bit discouraged with how January was going. While I started the year looking forward to taking on a list of goals, here we are, almost halfway into February, and I&#39;m not really feeling like I&#39;ve made real progress against any of them.
I took some time to think about why this is the case, and a couple of things stand out.</description>

      <description>Okay, so I&#39;m a bit late to the party, but: rather than try to create a bunch of resolutions, I’ve decided that I’d prefer to take on twelve projects this year. Why twelve? Well, largely because it breaks down to one project per month (not that I intend these to be month-long projects, it just works out that way).
In no particular order of importance, they are:

      <description>The last thing I wrote here was a retrospective on 2016, written one year and one day ago.
That&#39;s… quite a while ago. You&#39;d think I&#39;d have written more, given how much happened this year. Off the top of my head:
 I changed jobs, and am now working with the thoughtful geniuses at Fog Creek. I got pretty serious about personal fitness, making great progress, right up until… …I severed a tendon in my left pinky, which left me in a splint for most of the summer after surgery to reattach it (occupational and physical therapy are still ongoing, six months later) we lost our wonderful fluffy companion of 15 years  Aside from the fitness bit, none of these were events that I expected or planned for.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of the year, I wrote down some goals for 2016. The year has come and gone, so it&#39;s not a bad idea to have a bit of a look at how things went.
 Review 1. Post something here every Friday I did pretty well at this for a while, up until late August. But as the year wore on it felt more and more that I was writing just for the sake of checking off a repeating to-do item, rather than writing a goal in and of itself.</description>

      <description>As I write this, I&#39;m sitting at a Starbucks in a mall, two days before Christmas. I&#39;m sipping a large black coffee distractedly, watching folks noodle on by, caught up in whatever last few errands they may need to run before hosting or visiting friends and family for the holidays.
The mall&#39;s background music is calm, barely-audible, and shoppers don&#39;t seem particularly stressed out, or rushed, or frustrated.
It&#39;s possible that I&#39;m projecting my mood on this scene, too.</description>

 broken taking a quality nose-dive stupid irrelevant &amp;amp;cet.  And it&#39;s good to be critical. With a bit of healthy skepticism, we avoid the reality-distortion fields that turn rational-minded folks into zealots. Nothing is so perfect that it can&#39;t be improved, and I get that this is the place that a lot of these thinkpieces come from.</description>

Specifically, in light of the coming App Store purge, I&#39;ve been working on a big update to Per. While I&#39;m not especially concerned that Per, in its current form, is at risk of being culled, it has been a long time since it was updated.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s widely expected that the next iPhone will be announced tomorrow during the scheduled Apple Event. For months now, the rumour mill has been telling us that the most controversial change Apply is making to its flagship product is the removal of the headphone jack.
At this point, it seems like a certainty. The headphone jack in its current form has existed for decades, but Apple is notorious for advancing physical I/O past its status quo: witness the current MacBook with its single USB-C port, and recall the Lightning and 30-pin connectors on iOS devices, the adoption of Thunderbolt on current Macs, the even introduction of USB on the original iMac.</description>

      <description>I noticed this earlier in the year, but my iPhone is coming apart at the seams near the volume buttons.
At first, I figured I&#39;d managed to bend the phone, but upon closer inspection, both the back of the case and the screen are bulging outward—which is not the failure mode you&#39;d expect for a bent phone.
The gap at the seam is nearly 2mm, such that light from the screen leaks, but it&#39;s nowhere near as bad as I&#39;ve seen doing an image search.</description>

I used to think that I loved photography. I think I still do, I just&amp;hellip; never really do it anymore. At one point I had a whole mess of expensive camera gear, with the fancy full-frame digital SLR and red-ring&#39;d lenses. And the fast primes—oh, I loved those. Studio strobes? Yup. Speedlights? Several. Fifty pounds of camera gear that stayed home because, I convinced myself, I couldn&#39;t be arsed to carry fifty pounds of camera gear around with me.</description>

      <description>Last week, I wrote about weather apps that use the Dark Sky forecast API for weather data lacking the Canadian humidex.
Those that do tend to be riddled with ads and all kinds of content that, well, I don&#39;t care about. And naturally, I started thinking about how I use weather apps. All I really want from my is a couple of things:
 Current conditions, including humidex/ windchill values; Forecast conditions with highs and lows for today and tomorrow, again including humidex and windchill; Probability of precipitation for the next hour, with alerts of impending rain.</description>

&amp;mdash; Angelo Stavrow (@AngeloStavrow) August 4, 2016  I don&#39;t deal well with heat brought on by humidity. Which makes a Montreal summer pretty tough to deal with. Temperatures will routinely go over 30°C, but when combined with high humidity, it&#39;ll feel even hotter.
Like, three-showers-a-day-ain&#39;t-enough hot. Grimy, unpleasant, swampy hot.
And most weather apps out there don&#39;t get it.</description>

I haven&#39;t been able to find much on its usage aside from its original discussion on the swift-evolution mailing list and a Stack Overflow question, so here&#39;s a little bit of a discussion on how I&#39;m using it in a new project of mine.
Swift introduced some pretty neat error handling in 2.0, and Natasha the Robot provided a nice guide on how to throw an error in your code.</description>

      <description>This week, I took a hiatus from the refactoring fun I&#39;ve undertaken to (finally) move the blog over to a static site generator.
I&#39;ve written before about my plans to move to Hugo, and that&#39;s now complete. Since the beginning of the year, all posts have been written as Markdown files that I can easily grab and format with the necessary front matter. Before then, I hadn&#39;t written very much, and in fact I&#39;ve dropped a couple of old posts that I felt didn&#39;t add to the site in any way.</description>

No, for real.
Most content is already in place. A few older posts need to be added, and some info pages are to be added. This is normal-priority.
I&#39;m using a slightly-modified built-in template to render the site. There a few more modifications to make, but this is low-priority.
A commenting platform will be added. This is also normal-priority.</description>

      <description>The Great HoneyJar Refactoring is a series of posts in which I take the first iOS app I ever wrote, HoneyJar, and refactor it out of its original burning-dumpster-fire state and into a modern app. And I&#39;m doing it in public. Earlier this week, I tweeted about my adventures in trying to add a test suite to HoneyJar.
The idea is this: I want to be sure that I&#39;m not breaking anything in the app, as it exists right now, when I start refactoring.</description>

Of course, that doesn&#39;t make a difference if you&#39;re not commenting your code well.
Therein lies the rub. I spent weeks on learning various sorting algorithms in my data structures and algorithms class, but I never really learned anything on the whys and wherefores of commenting.

Yes, it&#39;s been a long time coming.
So I&#39;m setting a deadline for myself: the next post on this blog will be with the new setup. It probably won&#39;t have all the pieces in place re: design and other related-site plans, but I&#39;ve got to start somewhere.

      <description>As the sole developer at work, I have to balance our “ask me anything, anytime” culture with a need for unbroken concentration on whatever code I&#39;m writing.
I&#39;m generally fine with a door-always-open policy like this, because it makes communication fast and easy—especially in a small team, where everyone wears several hats—but as projects get closer to a deadline, it does tend to put a bit of strain on my ability to get things done.</description>

      <description>This is the 17th post made to this blog since the beginning of 2016.
That means that I&#39;ve posted something every Friday since the start of the year.
Yesterday, I suggested that I might not be posting anything today. I&#39;ve been feeling a bit tired lately as deadlines loom for work projects, so personal side-projects tend to slip a bit.
But, dammit, the idea of not breaking a streak—especially four months in—really does work as a motivator to keep things going.</description>

      <description>A short post today, based on a realization I had earlier this week at CocoaHeads.
Like many, I often suffer from impostor syndrome. It hits when I&#39;m tackling something new that I thought built on previous knowledge, leaving me feeling a bit bewildered, and undermining my confidence in having mastered lesser matters.
Usually, I take a walk and come back to the problem with a clearer head, and will work my way through it.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday of this week, Smile Software announced that their TextExpander software would be switching to a subscription model. As a longtime user and big fan of TextExpander, I have some thoughts on this change.
Another bit of software that I&#39;m a huge fan of, YNAB, made a similar switch at the end of 2015—no more desktop apps sold with traditional licenses, but rather a new web app with a yearly subscription.</description>

      <description>When I hear ship it, or we&#39;ll fix it in post&amp;rdquo;, I get that the intended sentiment is that perfect is the enemy of done. But too often, this translates to I&#39;m okay with shipping garbage.
There&#39;s a delicate balance to be struck between doing it quickly vs. doing it well, sure, but if you&#39;re having a hard time getting there, then maybe you&#39;ve bitten off more than you can chew.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, I had a chance to talk out my approach to learning new things in the context of Cocoa development.
I&#39;ve always found that I learn best when I get to use it in anger, but when it comes to something as big and sprawling as the Cocoa framework, there&#39;s a lot of stuff to learn.
Given that I do the vast majority of my development solo, I&#39;ve found that the best way to approach this is to break the framework down into manageable chunks, write a little project based around that chunk, and then ship it.</description>

      <description>As I&#39;ve mentioned before, I&#39;m looking into re-working things a little bit for some of my &amp;ldquo;online presence&amp;rdquo;.
Right now my personal site is just a static landing page. It&#39;s generated by Hugo and links to other things (this blog, my Tumblr, GitLab/GitHub, Twitter, &amp;amp;cet.)—and I think it&#39;s time to start consolidating some of that.
This blog will be moving to a static-site generator soon, too (again, Hugo). The domain and all links will remain active, but I&#39;d like it to also live under a /blog directory on my personal site.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, an article I wrote on setting up GitLab CI for your iOS projects was posted on the GitLab blog.
Now, I&#39;m a relative newcomer to continuous integration, but I know that it&#39;s valuable. And I also know that GitLab&#39;s feature is free, regardless of whether your project is public or private.
I also know that the best way to learn something is to show someone else how to do it—so I launched BBEdit and took notes as I worked my way through the setup, with the intention of posting something here about my experiences.</description>

      <description>While I don&#39;t have much to post here this week, I have been writing a technical article over the last couple of weeks. The final draft was submitted yesterday and, barring any unexpected changes or delays, it should be published next week.
It&#39;s been an interesting experience, and I intend on discussing it for next week&#39;s instalment.
Until then, I&#39;m trying to post fun little items and interesting links to Break Before Make more often, so feel free check check that out.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been thinking a bit about people and some popular techniques that they use to try to improve the quality of their lives.
Specifically, I wonder if successful application of GTD, YNAB&#39;s rules, or KonMari—essentially, the curation of stuff (life, money, possessions)—might be self-selecting.
Curation is maybe a bit of a weak description. These are methodologies for the processing of inputs with the goal of (typically measurable) progress towards a desired state.</description>

      <description>I rarely get sick, and when I do, it seldom lasts more than 72 hours. Having just recently gotten over a nasty cold, however, I have a couple of thoughts on the matter of working through cold and flu season.
Inevitably, there will always be someone who feels that they can&#39;t, for whatever reason, afford to take a sick day. So they load up on decongestants, fight their way in to the office, where they basically fill a seat with their butt, a trashcan with their snotty tissues, and their workplace with their germs.</description>

      <description>The January 28th episode of Under The Radar, Apps With Personality, left me thinking about just why software from bigger software publishers tend to be more… well, bland.
A lot of it surely comes down to the design-by-committee (or, in the worst case, design-by-accountants/lawyers) way of working that David and Marco alluded to, but I think there&#39;s something else worth considering.
Every business-school student has heard the (actually false) Chevy Nova &amp;ldquo;legend&amp;rdquo;, whereby GM execs scratched their heads in trying to figure out why sales of the car were so poor in Latin America.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been thinking about adding a second kind of post to this site every week: a selection links that I found to be an interesting read during the week.
More specifically, I&#39;m thinking about maybe three to five links, with a few words of my own commentary. Those links might be to freshly-published items, or they may be an interesting article from an archive somewhere. I don&#39;t really know.
What I do know, is that I come across a lot of thought-provoking, inspiring, or fascinating pieces of writing, and I want a more permanent place to share them than the Twitter firehose, or the Facebook walled garden.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been allowing myself to get too distracted by random projects. It&amp;#39;s time to cull that list and redouble my efforts on the key projects.
&amp;mdash; Angelo Stavrow (@AngeloStavrow) January 23, 2016  Years ago, as part of an engineering internship prep course, I had to do a Myers-Briggs personality test. The results indicated that I&#39;m an ENFP type.
While the MBTI was proven to be mostly malarky, one thing that keeps coming up about ENFP types is that they have trouble with follow-through.</description>

      <description>A short break from the usual posts for a bit of site news: by the end of February, I&#39;m hoping to have completed the move of this site over to a static-site generator called Hugo.
There are a few reasons for this.
First, I&#39;m ready to leave Squarespace. It&#39;s not that there&#39;s anything really wrong with their service. It&#39;s pretty reliable, their customer service is great, and it&#39;s generally pretty easy to use.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I wrote that I wanted to write more—primarily by posting to the blog once a week, and by writing in a journal daily.
So far, the journal has been a success. I haven&#39;t missed a day, because it&#39;s easy: I launch Day One on a device, and just write. I don&#39;t limit myself to certain topics, I don&#39;t use any tags, I don&#39;t add photos, and I certainly don&#39;t worry about length.</description>

 Be the person that makes you happy. Be the person that makes other people happy.  Here&#39;s the how and why of it, as I see it.

      <description>A lot of people seem to think that New Year&#39;s resolutions are a waste of time. While I agree that any day is a good day to make changes, I also know that I like things in neat and tidy little parcels, and a year is a very nice little short- to medium-term period of time for setting goals, and revisiting them to see how you did.
I didn&#39;t try anything like that for 2015.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m a firm believer in automation.
Computers are great environments for this—scripting languages (and convenient utilities that leverage them, like Hazel, TextExpander, or If This Then That) make it trivial to organize, queue, and execute all kinds of tasks that otherwise time away from more enjoyable things.

Life can be a bit harder to automate. It can get expensive, too, because automating real-life tasks tends to require both hardware and software, working in concert, to manipulate the physical world.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Make haste slowly.&amp;rdquo;
 Or, if we forsake brevity for clarity: get it done quickly, but not so urgently that thoroughness is sacrificed for speed.
Once committed to action, it is desirable to move swiftly, decisively; but to do so without having completed one&#39;s due diligence1 is foolhardy at best, and dangerous at worst.
 The hard part in all of this, of course, is know when the diligence is done and the planning can begin.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The only way to do great work is to love what you do.&amp;rdquo;
 I&#39;m not sure to whom the above quote is attributed, but I don&#39;t buy it.
The only way to do great work is to put in 100% of your attention and your effort, follow a thorough PDCA1 methodology, and understand that the quality of your work depends entirely on your will.
I get that this quote is supposed to be an inspirational call to action, but thinking that you can only excel at things that you love is equal parts reductive and defeatist.</description>

      <description>A calendar is, at its essence, just a list. But how effectively that list is used can transform your calendar from a mostly-neglected application to a finely-tuned productivity tool.
The key to this transformation is the proper care and feeding of your calendar. It is a garbage-in-garbage-out system, so it&#39;s crucial that we make sure that we only add items to our calendar that belong there.
For GTD acolytes like myself, it feels like we rise and fall by the quality of our lists.</description>

      <description>Remember Mortal Combat?
It was (and I guess still is) a fighting game whose claim to fame, when it was released in arcades back in the 90s, was the idea of a &amp;ldquo;finishing move&amp;rdquo;—if you beat your opponent, you had the opportunity to do a special attack, sending them off to meet their maker in a rather bloody fashion.
While I don&#39;t condone violence, the idea of a &amp;ldquo;finishing move&amp;rdquo; made me think a little bit about how I tend to deal with recurring tasks.</description>
