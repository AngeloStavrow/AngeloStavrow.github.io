            <p>I&rsquo;m being a bit more careful about defining goals this year. Certainly, there are some things that I&rsquo;m aiming to do, or that I need to do, but these things have to be balanced against the universe not especially giving a damn about my wants and needs — and I need to be okay with that. But more importantly, I&rsquo;m working harder on timeboxing my projects in OmniFocus, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve realized is that I’m happiest when I’m living a considered life. An examined life, in a sense, but without getting too mired in the details. I set <a href="/post/annual-review-2018">a bunch of goals that I couldn&rsquo;t (or didn&rsquo;t really want to) meet last year</a>, and I want to avoid that this year; I’ve learned the hard lesson that numbers measured and checkboxes ticked are worthless if they ignore the needs of <em>who I want to be</em> and <em>how I feel</em>, set in the context of <em>what I&rsquo;m capable of</em>.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve spent a bit of time thinking about this. Who am I? What is my True North? Knowing these things, how do I make sure my bearing is correctly set to get there?</p>

<p>I learned some important things over the last year. I&rsquo;m someone who needs focus time, and who needs to create things. I&rsquo;m someone that needs real-life social interaction. I need a solid seven hours of sleep, and I also need quiet time to be alone with my thoughts. Despite not having touched an instrument in over a decade, I still consider myself a musician. So I&rsquo;ve been working towards goals that meet these needs. Why then, are these projects mostly still sitting on the backburner?</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s because of pattern of &ldquo;overs&rdquo;. Overenthusiasm leads to overcommitment leads to overwhelm, and so I need some way to rein in that enthusiasm; I need to be more deliberate about how I treat my waking hours. Maybe it isn&rsquo;t a coincidence that a calendar resembles a chessboard; to carry the metaphor a little further, the way I&rsquo;ve been using my time feels more like I&rsquo;ve just been pushing pawns around willy-nilly, rather than playing strategic moves that get me to a win.</p>

<p>So, yeah. Being more deliberate with what I do means thinking more strategically about what I <em>can</em> do. I&rsquo;ve come to realize that my actions broadly fall in one of two categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The administrivia of everyday life:</strong> This includes the various one-off and/or recurring tasks that I can&rsquo;t forget, like checking the fire extinguisher, doing dishes and laundry, and other things you&rsquo;d find on single-action lists, as well as the meta-type projects that keep things on track, like doing a retrospective and planning session every week. I also include tracking lists like things to read, things to shop for, and so on in this category.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Goal-focused projects:</strong> These are the bigger projects focused on a very specific outcome. Until now, these are things that I&rsquo;ve been throwing into OmniFocus willy-nilly with aspirational intent, and that&rsquo;s not been working for me. One major thing I&rsquo;m addressing this year is setting a timeframe for projects. Not a due date, per se, but rather defining when I want to work on things. To that end, I&rsquo;ve created a nested folder structure in OmniFocus into which I&rsquo;ll arrange my projects:</p>

<pre><code>📂 Administrivia
📂 Meta/Maintenance
📂 Single-Action Lists
📂 Tracking Lists
📂 Projects
📂 Someday/Maybe
📂 Do this year
📂 Do in H1
  📂 Do in Q1
    📂 Do in January
    📂 Do in February
    📂 Do in March
  📂 Do in Q2
    📂 Do in April
    📂 Do in May
    📂 Do in June
📂 Do in H2
  📂 Do in Q3
    📂 Do in July
    📂 Do in August
    📂 Do in September
  📂 Do in Q4
    📂 Do in October
    📂 Do in November
    📂 Do in December
📂 Do next year
📂 Do in 3-5 years
📂 Do in 5+ years
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>This makes more sense to me over trying to define stuff as <em>Personal</em>, <em>Business</em>, <em>Hobbies</em>, &amp;cet. — after all, if it affects my life, it&rsquo;s personal. Rather, this gives me a better visual representation of how much I&rsquo;m packing into any given period of time. It&rsquo;s fine to punt from one period to another, but the key is to recognize that I only have so much time available to do things; unless &ldquo;the move makes sense on the chessboard,&rdquo; if you will, it remains an idea in my <em>Someday/Maybe</em> list, which can act as kind of a project backlog.</p>

<p>Projects will be added to the appropriate folder depending on how long I expect it will take to do it; in other words, if I think I can get a project done in a month, I&rsquo;ll add it to a month folder (e.g., <em>Do in February</em>). If it&rsquo;ll take three months or less, I&rsquo;ll add it to the appropriate quarter (e.g., <em>Do in Q2</em>). Six months or less, and the project goes in the appropriate half (e.g., <em>Do in H2</em>). And anything that I expect will take the entire year will go in <em>Do this year</em>.</p>

<p>This also gives me a better way to track progress against short-term (current/next year), medium-term (3-5 years), and long-term (5+ years) goals. So, if we have a goal of, say, visiting Japan in 2021, I&rsquo;ll add that project to the <em>Do in 3-5 years</em> folder, and as time moves forward I can see how I&rsquo;m progressing during my weekly reviews; eventually this project will be moved to the <em>Do next year</em> folder, and then somewhere in <em>Do this year</em>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll revisit how this is going for me every quarter, what changes I may have made, and what I&rsquo;ve noticed, but I&rsquo;m already feeling happy with how many stale projects have been dumping back into my <em>Someday/Maybe</em> list, how many were dropped, and the outline of the year that&rsquo;s beginning to unfold before my eyes.</p>
