        <section class="content e-content">
            <p>One of my goals for 2020 is to share more, and one of the ways I intend on doing this is to take photos more often and share them <a href="https://flickr.com/people/astavrow">on Flickr</a>. There&rsquo;s even a <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2020/01/30/the-february-photoblogging.html">daily-photo challenge on Micro.blog</a> to help kickstart that challenge. And since I can just plug any RSS feed into Micro.blog to pull in content, and I can generate Flickr RSS feeds from a given <code>tag</code>, we&rsquo;re golden! Just add the Flickr feed to Micro.blog, post one photo to Flickr daily with the tag <code>photoblog</code>, and it&rsquo;ll get shared to Micro.blog (which then cross-posts to other platforms, like Twitter). Great!</p>
<p>Except, right now, <a href="https://status.flickr.net/incidents/l3tvnc72m18c">Flickr search is broken</a>, so getting a feed of my photos filtered by tag returns… nothing.</p>
<p>But! I can create a <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a> app that uses the Flickr API to pull in my photos, filter them by tag, and generate an RSS feed of them. Yeah, that duplicates the functionality of Flickr&rsquo;s own built-in feed services, but hey, they&rsquo;re broken, and I can make this pretty easily, right? And once search is fixed, I can just turn off the app. <em>It&rsquo;ll be a fun learning experience.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of working on some other stuff right now. Those projects are far more important and/or time-sensitive, so I add this Flickr feed-generator app to my Someday/Maybe list in OmniFocus; it&rsquo;s neither important nor time-sensitive. Someday/Maybe lists are a collection of &ldquo;nice to haves&rdquo; — a backlog of project that you maybe want to do, someday.</p>
<p>A better turn of phrase is <em>the side-project graveyard</em>, as we call these lists on <a href="https://www.makebeforebreak.com">the show</a>.</p>
<h2 id="inflating-the-numbers">Inflating the numbers</h2>
<p>But the nature of this list, for me, is a little bit more insidious than that. As part of the weekly retrospective that I do, I go over my Someday/Maybe list, automatically bringing every one of those projects to the front of my attention. This routine signal boost makes sure these backlogged projects are kept on the radar.</p>
<p>I have never actually promoted anything from my Someday/Maybe list to an actual project that I tackle.</p>
<p>I have also almost never deleted an idea from my Someday/Maybe list, except during my annual purge.</p>
<p>I <em>have</em> demoted actual projects to my Someday/Maybe list.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what this does to me. Here&rsquo;s this list of projects that aren&rsquo;t important or urgent enough to take on, but I&rsquo;m reminded of them week after week. <em>Hey,</em> my system says, <em>don&rsquo;t forget about these things</em>. And so, as I go through my week, my planning is distracted by these ideas. I could be more ruthless about deleting them from the list, but, the fact is: I&rsquo;m a <a href="https://www.makebeforebreak.com/20">digital hoarder</a>.</p>
<p>So, today, I deleted the Someday/Maybe list in OmniFocus.</p>
<h2 id="organic-growth">Organic Growth</h2>
<p>For myself, it&rsquo;s probably better to ignore a new idea. I&rsquo;m too easily pulled off course by the promise of something new and shiny. Going forward, if I think of something interesting to make or do, I&rsquo;m going to push it aside.</p>
<p>If it eventually comes back, that&rsquo;ll be interesting. But that&rsquo;s not good enough — maybe I turn the idea over in my head a bit more, and write it down in my journal where I&rsquo;ll only see it maybe another couple of times in the year, and then I&rsquo;m going to push it away again.</p>
<p>But if it comes back to me a third time? That&rsquo;s probably a sign. That&rsquo;s maybe where you decide to create a project for it, either to tackle right away or sometime in the future. It&rsquo;s planned, and it&rsquo;s considered.</p>
<p>The ideas that pester you, that won&rsquo;t leave you alone, those are probably the ones you want to pay attention to. And you can&rsquo;t tell which ones they are, if you&rsquo;re pestering <em>yourself</em> with every idea you have.</p>
<p>More TK.</p>
