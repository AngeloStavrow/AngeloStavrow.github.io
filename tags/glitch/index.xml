      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks the second anniversary of my gig at &lt;a href=&#34;https://glitch.com&#34;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Fog Creek Software). Last year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://angelostavrow.com/post/remote-work-year-one/&#34;&gt;I wrote a retrospective&lt;/a&gt; on what the first year of working remotely was like; I thought it‚Äôd be fun to see how that‚Äôs evolved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday marked the end of my time working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://manuscript.com&#34;&gt;Manuscript&lt;/a&gt;, as the transition of the product over to its new owner is complete. With that, I&amp;rsquo;d been looking for a new contract, and today I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ll be joining the team at &lt;a href=&#34;https://glitch.com/about/&#34;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My main social network these days is &lt;a href=&#34;https://micro.blog/&#34;&gt;Micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, where I post short updates, thoughts, and images, then syndicate those posts out to the big social media silos. I have a hosted blog on the Micro.blog service for this, but because I want this site to be the canonical source for &lt;em&gt;all things Angelo&lt;/em&gt;, I wanted to pull in that content here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Glitch Project Name Lottery</title>

      <description>Glitch creates randomized project names when you remix a project, and they look something like adjective-noun.glitch.me. You can always rename these later, but oftentimes they‚Äôre just too amusing to bother (I‚Äôm looking at you, victorious-beer).
So, what if you decided that you were going to remix the node starter app, and then had to spend a couple of hours building an app based purely on the random name you were assigned?</description>

      <title>Remote Work: Year One</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, Julia Evans wrote a retrospective on what it‚Äôs been like working remotely that resonated with me, given that today is my one-year anniversary since taking a remote position. Since this is my first fully-remote job, taking some time to reflect on how things have gone seems like a good idea.
Julia answered some great questions about working remotely, so I‚Äôll do the same here.</description>
