      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks the second anniversary of my gig at &lt;a href=&#34;https://glitch.com&#34;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Fog Creek Software). Last year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://angelostavrow.com/post/remote-work-year-one/&#34;&gt;I wrote a retrospective&lt;/a&gt; on what the first year of working remotely was like; I thought it’d be fun to see how that’s evolved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, Julia Evans wrote a retrospective on what it’s been like working remotely that resonated with me, given that today is my one-year anniversary since taking a remote position. Since this is my first fully-remote job, taking some time to reflect on how things have gone seems like a good idea.
Julia answered some great questions about working remotely, so I’ll do the same here.</description>
