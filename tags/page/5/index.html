        Standing still is generally a safe bet. We don&rsquo;t have to expend any energy, and we don&rsquo;t have to concern ourselves much with the possible outcomes. We just stand there, and watch the world go by.
Making progress is a little different. Making progress is risky.

        Since mid-February, a notebook has become a big part of my productivity system. There&rsquo;s something about putting pen to paper that&rsquo;s inherently more satisfying to me than poking at keys to make characters appear on a screen. Over six months later, I&rsquo;m still writing in it daily.
I don&rsquo;t carry my notebook with me everywhere, though. I carry very little with me, in fact: my phone, wallet, and my keys (and really, only the keys that I need).

        Glitch creates randomized project names when you remix a project, and they look something like adjective-noun.glitch.me. You can always rename these later, but oftentimes they’re just too amusing to bother (I’m looking at you, victorious-beer).
So, what if you decided that you were going to remix the node starter app, and then had to spend a couple of hours building an app based purely on the random name you were assigned?

        It&rsquo;s been almost four months since I last wrote something. I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy over the last little while completely overhauling this site, and there are a few changes that I&rsquo;d like to point out.

        Tell me if any of this sounds familiar:
 Why am I having such a hard time with this? What&rsquo;s wrong with me? Maybe I’m not smart enough to do this. People hired me to do this work, but I&rsquo;m never going to figure this out. I&rsquo;m a fraud.  There are at least a couple of common threads with these statements, but I think the most interesting one is that each of these statements is an implicit comparison that I&rsquo;m making between myself and someone that&rsquo;s, y&rsquo;know, good at what they do.

        I&rsquo;ve got some iOS apps as side projects (they&rsquo;re in dire need of updates, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there). To keep things organized, I use a Manuscript (née FogBugz) account that I opened six years ago for planning work and, more relevant to this post, to capture (almost) all customer feedback. There&rsquo;s a custom mailbox set up with an email address in my business domain, to which customers can send questions and comments about the apps.

        A couple of weeks ago, Julia Evans wrote a retrospective on what it’s been like working remotely that resonated with me, given that today is my one-year anniversary since taking a remote position. Since this is my first fully-remote job, taking some time to reflect on how things have gone seems like a good idea.
Julia answered some great questions about working remotely, so I’ll do the same here.
What’s scary about working remote?

        I&rsquo;ve slowly been moving over to Things 3 for task management, but more than that, I&rsquo;ve been re-thinking just how my system needs to be fleshed out so that it works best for me.
As part of that move, I&rsquo;ve been re-evaluating the way I think about capture. Typically, you&rsquo;ve got an inbox, where you log all the incoming stuff in your life, and which you process periodically. That&rsquo;s fine for the usual do-delegate-delete-defer type tasks, but if I want to use Things (or whatever task management system) to capture everything, I&rsquo;ve found that I need a place for things that live somewhere between the inbox and a project.

        I mentioned the other day that I&rsquo;m feeling a little bit discouraged with how January was going. While I started the year looking forward to taking on a list of goals, here we are, almost halfway into February, and I&rsquo;m not really feeling like I&rsquo;ve made real progress against any of them.
I took some time to think about why this is the case, and a couple of things stand out.

        Okay, so I&rsquo;m a bit late to the party, but: rather than try to create a bunch of resolutions, I’ve decided that I’d prefer to take on twelve projects this year. Why twelve? Well, largely because it breaks down to one project per month (not that I intend these to be month-long projects, it just works out that way).
In no particular order of importance, they are:
