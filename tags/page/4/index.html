        I've slowly been moving over to Things 3 for task management, but more than that, I've been re-thinking just how my system needs to be fleshed out so that it works best for me.
As part of that move, I've been re-evaluating the way I think about capture. Typically, you've got an inbox, where you log all the incoming stuff in your life, and which you process periodically. That's fine for the usual do-delegate-delete-defer type tasks, but if I want to use Things (or whatever task management system) to capture everything, I've found that I need a place for things that live somewhere between the inbox and a project.

        I mentioned the other day that I'm feeling a little bit discouraged with how January was going. While I started the year looking forward to taking on a list of goals, here we are, almost halfway into February, and I'm not really feeling like I've made real progress against any of them.
I took some time to think about why this is the case, and a couple of things stand out.

        Okay, so I'm a bit late to the party, but: rather than try to create a bunch of resolutions, I’ve decided that I’d prefer to take on twelve projects this year. Why twelve? Well, largely because it breaks down to one project per month (not that I intend these to be month-long projects, it just works out that way).
In no particular order of importance, they are:
 Learn a new language: My wife and I have been talking about doing this together.

        The last thing I wrote here was a retrospective on 2016, written one year and one day ago.
That's… quite a while ago. You'd think I'd have written more, given how much happened this year. Off the top of my head:
 I changed jobs, and am now working with the thoughtful geniuses at Fog Creek. I got pretty serious about personal fitness, making great progress, right up until… …I severed a tendon in my left pinky, which left me in a splint for most of the summer after surgery to reattach it (occupational and physical therapy are still ongoing, six months later) we lost our wonderful fluffy companion of 15 years  Aside from the fitness bit, none of these were events that I expected or planned for.

        At the beginning of the year, I wrote down some goals for 2016. The year has come and gone, so it's not a bad idea to have a bit of a look at how things went.
 Review 1. Post something here every Friday I did pretty well at this for a while, up until late August. But as the year wore on it felt more and more that I was writing just for the sake of checking off a repeating to-do item, rather than writing a goal in and of itself.

        As I write this, I'm sitting at a Starbucks in a mall, two days before Christmas. I'm sipping a large black coffee distractedly, watching folks noodle on by, caught up in whatever last few errands they may need to run before hosting or visiting friends and family for the holidays.
The mall's background music is calm, barely-audible, and shoppers don't seem particularly stressed out, or rushed, or frustrated.
It's possible that I'm projecting my mood on this scene, too.

        I see a lot of digital ink spilled on how some particular thing is
 broken taking a quality nose-dive stupid irrelevant &amp;cet.  And it's good to be critical. With a bit of healthy skepticism, we avoid the reality-distortion fields that turn rational-minded folks into zealots. Nothing is so perfect that it can't be improved, and I get that this is the place that a lot of these thinkpieces come from.

        I haven't posted here in a little while, thus breaking the streak that I was intending to maintain. I don't feel too bad about this, because I've been working on other stuff in the meanwhile, but it's nice to be writing again.
Specifically, in light of the coming App Store purge, I've been working on a big update to Per. While I'm not especially concerned that Per, in its current form, is at risk of being culled, it has been a long time since it was updated.

        It's widely expected that the next iPhone will be announced tomorrow during the scheduled Apple Event. For months now, the rumour mill has been telling us that the most controversial change Apply is making to its flagship product is the removal of the headphone jack.
At this point, it seems like a certainty. The headphone jack in its current form has existed for decades, but Apple is notorious for advancing physical I/O past its status quo: witness the current MacBook with its single USB-C port, and recall the Lightning and 30-pin connectors on iOS devices, the adoption of Thunderbolt on current Macs, the even introduction of USB on the original iMac.

        I noticed this earlier in the year, but my iPhone is coming apart at the seams near the volume buttons.
At first, I figured I'd managed to bend the phone, but upon closer inspection, both the back of the case and the screen are bulging outward—which is not the failure mode you'd expect for a bent phone.
The gap at the seam is nearly 2mm, such that light from the screen leaks, but it's nowhere near as bad as I've seen doing an image search.
