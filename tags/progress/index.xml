      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love cooking, and get myself little gadgets and tools for the kitchen more often than I should, because having the right tool for the job makes things so much more pleasant and makes me more effective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hello, 2019</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m being a bit more careful about defining goals this year. Certainly, there are some things that I&amp;rsquo;m aiming to do, or that I need to do, but these things have to be balanced against the universe not especially giving a damn about my wants and needs — and I need to be okay with that. But more importantly, I&amp;rsquo;m working harder on timeboxing my projects in OmniFocus, for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re coming to the end of the year, a time when I can’t help but look back at how the year went and reflect on my wins, losses, and lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On risk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Standing still is generally a safe bet. We don&amp;rsquo;t have to expend any energy, and we don&amp;rsquo;t have to concern ourselves much with the possible outcomes. We just stand there, and watch the world go by.&lt;/p&gt;
