        In other news, Iâ€™m totally ready for this sweltering summer to be over.
&mdash; Angelo Stavrow (@AngeloStavrow) August 4, 2016 
I don&rsquo;t deal well with heat brought on by humidity. Which makes a Montreal summer pretty tough to deal with. Temperatures will routinely go over 30&deg;C, but when combined with high humidity, it&rsquo;ll feel even hotter.
Like, three-showers-a-day-ain&rsquo;t-enough hot. Grimy, unpleasant, swampy hot.
And most weather apps out there don&rsquo;t get it.

&mdash; Angelo Stavrow (@AngeloStavrow) May 14, 2016 
A couple of months ago I played a little bit with PassKit and Wallet after finding this little tutorial on adding a business card to Passbook (now named Wallet).
A Wallet pass is pretty easy to create&mdash;just fill some metadata into a JSON file, create a Pass Type ID certificate in your Apple Developer account, and then run a signing utility.

        There&rsquo;s a new kid on the XCTest block, and its name is XCTAssertThrowsError.
I haven&rsquo;t been able to find much on its usage aside from its original discussion on the swift-evolution mailing list and a Stack Overflow question, so here&rsquo;s a little bit of a discussion on how I&rsquo;m using it in a new project of mine.
Swift introduced some pretty neat error handling in 2.0, and Natasha the Robot provided a nice guide on how to throw an error in your code.

        In moving this blog to a static site generator, one concern was whether I&rsquo;d still be able to work on and/or publish a post from my phone. I tend to do a fair bit of mobile drafting while I&rsquo;m in the subway or waiting in line, and will sometimes publish content when I&rsquo;m away from my computer. YOLO.
Requirements It&rsquo;s a given&mdash;since that&rsquo;s how the site has been setup&mdash;that you need a GitLab.

        As I mentioned last week, today is July 1st, which marks a convenient half-way point for the year. On New Year&rsquo;s Day, I posted a short list of goals that I was hoping to make progress towards. Here&rsquo;s how it all breaks down.
1. Post something here every Friday. So far, so good. I haven&rsquo;t missed a single week, which I&rsquo;m pretty pleased with. I&rsquo;ll grant that it hasn&rsquo;t always (ever?

 Next week is July the first. It&rsquo;s Canada Day here, which means it&rsquo;s a national holiday, but in Montreal, it&rsquo;s also an unofficial moving day.
So it&rsquo;s a propos that this site will be moving over to its new digs on that same day.

        This week, I took a hiatus from the refactoring fun I&rsquo;ve undertaken to (finally) move the blog over to a static site generator.
I&rsquo;ve written before about my plans to move to Hugo, and that&rsquo;s now complete. Since the beginning of the year, all posts have been written as Markdown files that I can easily grab and format with the necessary front matter. Before then, I hadn&rsquo;t written very much, and in fact I&rsquo;ve dropped a couple of old posts that I felt didn&rsquo;t add to the site in any way.

        I&rsquo;m in the process of (finally) finalizing the move of this site to Hugo.
No, for real.
Most content is already in place. A few older posts need to be added, and some info pages are to be added. This is normal-priority.
I&rsquo;m using a slightly-modified built-in template to render the site. There a few more modifications to make, but this is low-priority.
A commenting platform will be added. This is also normal-priority.

        The Great HoneyJar Refactoring is a series of posts in which I take the first iOS app I ever wrote, HoneyJar, and refactor it out of its original burning-dumpster-fire state and into a modern app. And I'm doing it in public. Earlier this week, I tweeted about my adventures in trying to add a test suite to HoneyJar.
The idea is this: I want to be sure that I&rsquo;m not breaking anything in the app, as it exists right now, when I start refactoring.
